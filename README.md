# Style

Style is a website designed for artists to streamline their scheduling process with customers while also helping them gain more exposure to potential clients. Our platform provides an easy-to-use scheduling feature and an algorithm that connects artists with new clients based on their preferences and service needs.

## Features

- **Streamlined Scheduling**: Artists can manage appointments easily, reducing the hassle of manual scheduling and giving them more time to focus on their craft.
- **Client Exposure**: Our algorithm promotes new artists' profiles to potential clients, helping them grow their business and reach a broader audience.
- **Artist Profiles**: Each artist has a customizable profile page where they can showcase their services, availability, and portfolio.
- **Customer Reviews**: Clients can leave reviews after appointments, boosting the artist's credibility and reputation.
- **Service Categories**: Supports a variety of artist types such as barbers, hair stylists, tattoo artists, nail technicians, and more.
- **Appointment Notifications**: Automatic email notifications for both the artist and the client about upcoming and canceled appointments.

## How It Works

1. **Artist Registration**: Artists sign up, create a profile, and set their services availability for appointments.
2. **Scheduling**: Clients can visit an artist's page, select a service, and book an appointment based on available time slots.
3. **Exposure**: Our platform's algorithm continuously showcases artists to clients through a dynamic, rotating feed, ensuring a fresh selection of talent is always visible. Additionally, we highlight a special category for new artists who have been operating for less than 6 months, giving them an extra boost in exposure
4. **Review System**: After each service, clients can leave feedback, helping other potential clients make informed decisions.
